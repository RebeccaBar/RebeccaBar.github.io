            <h2>project overview</h2>
            <p>This project was personally important to me because it was an opportunity to help healthcare workers, who
                sacrifice their own mental and physical health for our well-being on a daily basis.</p>
            <p>The tools they use to manage patient workflow are often complicated and frustrating. Caresight was a
                chance to remove some of the stress that healthcare workers encounter on the job by providing more
                intuitive and analytics-based tools that help them make smarter, more data-driven decisions.</p>
            <p>Caresight also allowed me to grow through the coaching and mentoring of the junior designers on my team.

                <h3>project atmosphere and challenges</h3>
                <p>I was called in to work with the agency owner on a top client’s project.</p>
                <p>The agency and client were at a crossroads with this project. It went through a few different rounds
                    of iteration, but the project still suffered from persistent issues.</p>
                <p>My role was to come in and help the agency refine the project while also presenting the work and
                    establishing strong and positive communication with their client.</p>
                <p>I was joining the project late in the process on a tight deadline, and needed to learn as much as I
                    could about users from existing research.</p>
                <p>I worked closely with the agency owner, leveraging their library of prior research on their user
                    groups.</p>

                <h3>the client</h3>
                <p>Caresight is an advanced reporting and analytics-as-a-service solution focused on reducing risk and
                    improving caregiver/patient experiences.</p>
                <p>Caresight has decades of experience in nursing management and clinical workflows, and the agency and
                    Caresight have been working together for over 10 years.</p>

                <h3>the users</h3>
                <p>Hospitals are extremely high-stress environments, and are becoming increasingly more data-driven.
                    This particular project had three user types to design for.</p>
                <p>Two of them, Nurses and Healthcare Administrators are split-attention users. Due to the nature of
                    their job, they cannot dedicate all of their attention to the interface that they are using.
                    Therefore, the majority of design decisions were made with them in mind.</p>
                <p>The client requested one universal home screen that will work simultaneousely for the information
                    each user would need (and are privy to) see.</p>

                            <p>Recent reports (05/2019), show that nearly 30% of all nurses suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).</p>
                            <p>To help reduce their stress, our goal was to help them find the information they need fast, and provide some personal, conversational writing that would give them some sense of appreciation and caring from their superiors.</p>

                            <p>Their duties include coordinating information between clinicians and facilities, patients, and other key personnel.</p>
                            <p>Admin work is detailed and difficult. It is not uncommon for admins to work long after their allotted shifts and hours, so it’s imperative that their tools are efficient and straightforward.</p>

                <p>We wanted to solve this problem without resorting to error message and frustraing the user with
                    re-directions. Here are some of the solutions we tried:</p>
                <ul class="stories">
                    <li>A Wizard Nav explaining the parent-child relationships</li>
                    <li>An Infographic demonstrating the navigation steps</li>
                    <li>Adding quantity numbers to each parent in the left-rail</li>
                    <li>Making items in the left-rail hoverable to show dropdowns allowing the user to choose all
                        relationships at once</li>
                    <li>A right-panel modal that appears when user clicks on a child relationship too soon, prompting
                        them to choose the proper parent relationships first.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Ultimately, all of these paths were too long and not intuitive enough.</p>

                                    <p>This project was under a tight deadline which forced me to prioritize the bigger
                                        picture. Once that was addressed, we could come back and address the details
                                        that could be adjusted later.</p>
                                    <p>I learned a lot about timing and how ongoing deliberation can affect the overall
                                        build of a product on a short notice.</p>
                                    <p>I also learned a lot about project planning. Being brought into the project
                                        relatively late can be a disadvantage, but that doesn’t mean that the outcome
                                        will be less than stellar when we focus on prioritizing user needs and use our
                                        resources and dedication towards that goal.</p>

                                    <h3>leadership</h3>
                                    <p>I’ve managed remote teams before, but as UX Lead, this was the first time I was
                                        asked to mentor other designers while guiding them through the project.</p>
                                    <p>This included creating user personas and flows with a junior UX designer and
                                        visual designer in order to explain how we’re making user-centered design
                                        decisions.</p>
                                    <p>My role was to guide the team to work together and provide them with the
                                        confidence they needed, while making sure the project was up-to-par for the
                                        client.</p>
                                    <p>This was an exercise in balance because while I wanted to trust these designers,
                                        they were hourly employees. A big portion of my job was to provide guidance and
                                        guardrails to protect both the agency owner and the clients needs.</p>

                        <p>As with every project, I am truly grateful to have been given the opportunity to learn and
                            grow as a person and as a designer. I look forward to future collaboration with the team,
                            should I be needed again.</p>
