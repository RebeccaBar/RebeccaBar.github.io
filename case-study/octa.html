                <h3>The problem:</h3>
                <p>Business owners are struggling every day  to manage an overwhelming amount of tasks and information.
                From customer care and supplier relations to receiving merchandise and overseeing quality control, thereâ€™s always something that needs their immediate attention.  </p>
                <h3>The product:</h3>
                <p>OCTA was designed to meet the unique needs of these business owners.  It was originally conceived as a Cloud app for small business owners to store & share information with their suppliers.  After conducting vigorous user research, that changed to reflect our target users needs and pain points.  OCTA evolved a couple steps further into an app that helps a busy business owner run their business better.  All tailored to their unique workflow.  As told by them.</p>
