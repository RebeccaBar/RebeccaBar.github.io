                                <p>Originally conceived as a Cloud app, comprehensive user research led OCTA to evolve into an app that helps people run the hardest parts of their business better.</p>

                    <p>Google Drive, Camcard, and Neat are all cloud applications that business owners use to organize different aspects of their business.  Google Drive is an “all-in-one”, Camcard stores business contacts and posts news and updates, and Neat helps organize documents for accounting and tax time.</p>

                    <h3>User surveys</h3>
                    <p class="button-margin">User surveys were sent out to 20 potential users.  There were 12 retailers and eight wholesalers in the cohort.  40% of particiants were between the age of 35-44.  33.3% were between the ages of 45-54, the remaining 26.7% were between the ages of 55-64.  I learned what tools they're currently using, what they felt was missing from these tools, and what they liked best about them.  I also learned that there are a diverse set of business tools I hadn't considered were potential competitors. These included Dropbox, Pinterest, iCloud, and Instagram.  I learned that even users that own or work at bigger companies with larger budgets don't want to pay a lot for a storage product.  I learned that over 80% of users prefer to separate their business communication to their personal whats app and email accounts.</p>

                        <p class="button-margin">I visited three showrooms in Manhattan and attended their daily sales appointments to learn more about how retailers and wholesalers work with eachother. I also visited two small stores and shadowed their business owner for a day to learn how they handle their multi-tasking between customer service and logistics.</p>

                        <h3>Interviews</h3>
                        <p class="button-margin">14 users in the survey cohort agreed to be interviewed. Nine of these users were retailers and five were wholesalers. I learned what frustrates them the most in their business, what their business goals are, and what motivates them.
                <section>
                    <h3>User personas</h3>
                    <p>These personas were created from the data collected from the user surveys, interviews, and on-location observation.</p>
                    <div class="twoCol-center">

                            <p>Jen is a retailer and serial entrepenuer.  She is excessively organized and cares a lot about making her customers happy.</p>

                            <p> Kew is a veteran wholesaler.  He sells to independent retailers like Jen and small department stores.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <p class="button-margin">I learned that Both Jen and Kew think they’re a LOT more technologically saavy than they really are.  That solidified the need for OCTA to be very intuitive. From talking to and observing business owners in real-time, I learned that they feel best when in a fast-paced environment and when they feel they are getting things done. OCTA’s microcopy would need to feed that feeling by providing a lot of positive reinforcement.</p>

                        <h3>User flows</h3>
                        <h5>ONBOARDING</h5>
                        <p>I cancelled OCTA’s onboarding altogether after showing it to a senior design mentor.  As intuitive it proved to be during prototyping, she taught me that the most intuitive onboarding is no onboarding at all.</p>
                        <h5>SAVING AN ITEM</h5>
                        <p>Research showed me what tools potential users are currently using for their business.  I designed the original “Saving an Item” flow to pull data from Quickbooks, Google Drive, Excel, or Dropbox.</p>
                        <h5>REPORTING A DAMAGE / SHIPPING MISTAKE</h5>
                        <p>By searching for the invoice number and choosing a “reason for return” or “type of damage”, a user can report a shipping mistake of damage.  To remain consistent with the users need for better communication, I did not offer an open text field. This could be a platform for negative and emotional text that might  potentially harm a business relationship.</p>
                        <h5>GENERATING AN INVOICE ON SITE</h5>
                        <p>Some companies reported having a number/letter system for their invoices.  Some didn’t at all, and the process of creating one was distracting.  Therefore, I designed an option to add a custom invoice number or generate a new one while creating an invoice.</p>
                        <h5>MESSAGING / COMMUNICATION</h5>
                        <p class="button-margin">The original user flow for messaging included the abiity to send voice messages, but that was dropped during the HIFI design.  Voice messages would be both expensive for the app to store and counter-productive.  Users had reported “not being able to find or remember” where they communicated with each seller. Listening to multiple voice messages wouldn’t make that any easier.</p>

                    <h5>MIND MAPPING</h5>
                    <p>These mind maps are a combination of user research, observation, and empathy.  Each potental function of the app grew into possible directions to explore and sometimes problems that could arise.  For example, being able to message multipe wholesalers at once was a high priority.   Retail users had shared their competitive nature with me during interviews and observations and I spotted that this could present a serious privacy problem for them.  It could also cause a lot of return spam messages.  I needed to design messaging in a direct way that would circumvent these problems before they would have the chance to materialize.</p>
                    <img class="full" src="../images/first-octa-sketch-big.png" alt="Image of Mind Mapping for OCTA">
                    <p>To name the app, I tried words for commerce in different ancient languages like Latin and Hebrew.  I researched the origin of commerce and read up on the historical silk and spice trade routes.  I played around with Greek Mythology, such as Atlas.   The idea was that the app would take all the weight of running a business off our users shoulders. </p>

                    <h5>MORE SKETCHING</h5>
                    <p>User research showed that privacy and safety are top priority for a business owner, which led me to potentially naming the app, “Cell”.  This solution was backed by two sketches:  One reminscint of a prison or bank cell, that holds, watches, and keeps info safe until the moment you need it.  The other was a cell graph which looks like a business is trending and growing.  At the same time I contemplated Atlas, I also contemplated Mercator with a “superhero” cape.  That idea was meant to make a user feel that someone is swooping in to help them run their business stronger and faster.  Cell had too negative a conotation and Mercator was both taken and over-the-top.</p>

                    <p>I did some research on acronyms and explored a few possibilities, but ended on OCTA.  OCTA fit because I realized from my interviews that business owners feel like they have to do everything on their own.  They don’t neccesarily want to hire more help, they just feel like they need an extra pair (or three!) of hands.  The octopus seemed to fit perfectly.  ANd OCTA also stands for “Organizing Communication for Better Trade and Accontability”.  This covers all the problems that OCTA solves, in a nutshell.</p>

                    <h5>MOODBOARD / LOGO</h5>
                    <p>My research showed that business owners are used to using products like Dropbox, LinkedIn, Evernote, and Quickbooks for their business.</p>
                    <p>OCTA needed to mirror what a user would expect from a big brand like that, but stand out as a unique solution on their own.  I used a mixture of blues and greens to create a solid graident that gives OCTA a modern, professional and approachful personality.</p>

                    <p>Trying some different Octopus icons on the graident background gave me a better direction to push OCTA’s logomark back to B&W.  While I needed to show the extra “hands” (tentacles) to best communicate OCTA’s brand message, the multiple tentacles looked childish and unclear.  I showcased just of them in the option 3 in the second sketch below, did some preference testing, and got excellent feedback.</p>

                    <p>I conducted A/B testing on OCTA’s logo mark with 20 potential users.  Since opinions were split exactly in half, I paid close attention the the reasoning behind each user’s choice.    The testers that liked the closed logo mark said things like, “It’s more clear/complete/defined”.  The testers that liked the open mark better said it looked more “modern, compelling, and professional.  Since OCTA is an app looking to modernize the way business owners work, we stuck with the open mark. </p>

                    <h3 class="learned">What I Learned</h3>
                    <p>If I were to start this project over, I probably would design OCTA to be less mobile-specific and more operating system agnostic.  I was very focused on giving the user the ability to create invoices and report damages using their phone’s camera, and I didn’t take enough time to research other ways I can achieve that.  I’d like to update the design based on development and usage discovery.</p>
                    <p>After my research and design was complete, the developer and I opted to switch OCTA from a mobile app to a progressive web app.  The developer will still style the app with my iOS-like design, but it will work across mobile and other devices as a PWA.</p>
                    <p>Based on the observations and user research I did, we suspect that our wholesale users will use the mobile version a lot less, which is what prompted our late decision to build OCTA as a PWA.  The basic version of the wholesale-side will be free.  We want to encourage wholesalers to connect with their retailers through the app.  We plan on showing OCTA to wholesalers at trade shows to spread the word.  Once we have a large data-base, we can offer a paid version of the program to wholesalers that helps them grow their business by finding more customers.</p>
                    <p class="button-margin">It’s been a pleasure working on OCTA.  I learned a lot about what it’s like to own and run a business.  I look forward to helping further!</p>
