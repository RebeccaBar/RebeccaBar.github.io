            <h3>inspired by differences</h3>
            <img src="../images/rebecca-pic-big.png" alt="Picture of Rebecca">
            <p>I was born and raised in Upstate, NY.  As a fourth generation American with European roots on my father’s side and Syrian-Israeli on my mother’s side, I’m no novice when it comes to diversity.</p>
            <p>Growing up with two very different and sometimes opposing mentalities is a big part of who I am.  Today, my own viewpoints live in nuance beyond just one universal solution.</p>
            <p>From my mother’s side of the family, I inherited a deep sense of empathy, creativity, and entrepreneurship.  From my fathers side,  an engineers curiosity, inventor’s idealism, strong moral character, and, somewhat less pragmatic, some pretty deadpan sarcasm.</p>
            <p>The run-on sentences are all mine.  Case in point.</p>
            <h3>my early design education</h3>
            <p>I spent my childhood and early adulthood working in my familys business, a 4000 square foot women’s boutique.  While my peers were going to camp, I was attending trade shows with my mom, visual merchandising, and personal clothes shopping for women many times my own age.</p>
            <p>That is where I first learned, hands-on, how to observe human behavior.  When there were customers in the store, there was always something to do.  Be observant, be available, be helpful.  When out on a buying trip, mom taught me to buy what our customers liked, not what I liked.</p>
            <p> To learn more about my experience, read an article I wrote about it here.</p>
            <h3>my journey to product design</h3>
            <p>I gained a lot of rich entrepenurial experiences in my family business, including helping them design and open three new stores from the ground up.  I also learned a lot about fashion design and helped design fashion that fit and flattered a lot better than our previous offerings.</p>
            <p>Enough time passed for me to be a busy mom myself, and I started to become a little disconnected (and maybe bored) with the fashion world.  As a busy entrepenuer, I was always looking for ways to spend more quality time with my own kids.  I observed other parents all the time, and found that hands-on quality time with their kids was really missing from their lives.</p>
            <p>I started my own wholesale company called Silicandy™, with the mission of getting families back together in the kitchen.  I designed all the products to be kid-friendly and fun, yet beautiful and functional enough for a parent to want to stock them in their kitchen.  You can read a lot more about them in my case study.</p>
            <p>There was another really important element to Silicandy, which was to make it easy for retailers to find my company and to show them what made our products different.  I went through four different graphic designers and iterations on the webpage before I just decided to learn how to make one myself.  The other designers really weren’t focused on presenting the information in a way my customers would need to see it, and that really bothered me.  The customer experience has always been just as, if not more important to me than the product.</p>
            <p>I led the web design with a UX focus including customer research and phone calls with some of my retailers while designing.</p>
            <p>Then my developer made a comment about the fact that Id make a great UX designer.</p>
            <p>Growing up as an entrepenuer, I never really knew there was another option.  I had always been very ‘tech-y’, but I always nixed going into tech as a profession because “I can’t sit in front of a computer all day, I need to be around people”.</p>
            <p>My inclination has always been to serve others in some way.  My experience with running my own businesses taught me a lot about my strengths, weaknesses, and passions.  The part I loved most about my businesses (and was best at) was designing products and experiences for others.</p>
            <p>I decided to close my business and focus on designing products full-time.  I enrolled in full-time UX design apprentiship program for 15 months, where I worked daily with some of the best senior designers I’ve met.</p>
            <p>I’ve always been one to work hard / play hard.    Being able to focus on designing and solving problems all day long makes me feel like I’m always playing.  Now I just take playtime a lot more seriousely.</p>
            <h3>life, liberty, and the pursuit of good design</h3>
            <p>While you’re reading this, I’m probaby either designing, or learning new technologies to help me implement my ideas.  Whether it be animation, more advanced CSS, or new software (Axure is next), there’s always something on my list.</p>
            <p>Being able to make things and serve others is what makes me feel alive.  My favorite U.S. president, Abraham Lincoln, said, “You cannot escape the responsibility of tomorrow by evading it today”.  I found my purpose in practising effective and ethical design as my way of helping to shape the future.</p>
